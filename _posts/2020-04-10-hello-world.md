Hello, and welcome to my site!

I am TruDev. I made this site to keep track of my progress and show it to the
world. I'm planning on making some games with Godot Engine. I also would like to
make a few websites/webapps while I'm at it. If you have any questions, or would
like to talk to me, my Twitter is [@TruDev_](https://twitter.com/TruDev_), and I
have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kqJQHbs).

Have fun!
