Hey, my first real post!

One of the main reasons I made this blog was to document my progress in Godot.
I had used it some *years* back, so I was basically a beginner again. But, my
ways with code did not fail me, thankfully. I managed to figure it out, and to
exceed expectations by adding a difficulty menu!

Godot was pretty fun to work with, and I look forwards to working with it in
the future!

Thanks for reading, and I included some download links for you so you can
enjoy my creations! At time of writing, I have no idea of where I'm gonna host
these games, so I hope I can find one...

Edit: nvm GitHub works
