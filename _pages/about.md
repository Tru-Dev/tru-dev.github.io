Hello, and welcome to my site! I am TruDev, and I do stuff, such as:
- Code
- Draw/Doodle
- Make Music
I really like video games, but I like making them too.
That's why I started this blogfolio, to document my creation of a video game!

If you're still reading, here's some of my favorite video games/inspirations:
- [Copy Kitty](https://store.steampowered.com/app/349250/Copy_Kitty/)
- [OneShot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/)
- Touhou Project

Have fun!
